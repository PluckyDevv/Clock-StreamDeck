# Clock on Stream Deck

Display the date and time on a key of your Stream Deck.
I'm using a title to display the information so you can customize the font, size, color, etc.

## Display

```text
10:00:00
2026-01-01
```

```text
HH:MM:SS
YYYY-MM-DD
```

## Contribution, issues, etc.

I use it and update it according to my needs.
If you wish, you can report an issue or make a PR, but I may not follow up.
